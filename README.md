* OBJECTIVE : 
	- Building a multi-class for MNIST digit database
	
* SOLUTION USED :
	- Convolutional Neural Network ensemble (voting system by 5 networks trained on different portions of the training dataset)
	- Data augmentation with random shift, rotation and zoom, on the training set to avoid overfitting, diversify the digit patterns

* REMARKS :
	- A troubleshooting analysis with a confusion matrix is made at the end to better understand witch are the
	  misclassifications made by the model
